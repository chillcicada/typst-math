# Fonts
This directory contains fonts used by the extension.
You can install them on your system by :
- Downloading the [zip file](https://github.com/supersurviveur/typst-math/raw/master/fonts/fonts.zip) or the three individual fonts, and then installing them manually on your system.
- During the first launch of the extension, you will be prompted to install them automatically (Works only on Windows).
